## Setup
These instructions will help you get the APLAN workbench up and running on your local machine. 

1. Install FreeCAD: https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Manual:Installing.
2. The APLAN workbench isn't yet available in FreeCAD's addon manager. For the time being, a manual installation (see section below) is required.
3. Install the requisite Python packages:
```
$ cd ~/.FreeCAD/Mod/FreeCAD-APLAN/
$ pip3 install wheel
$ pip3 install .
```

### Installation
#### Manual installation on Linux distributions w/o using Git
* Within your home folder's (hidden) directory ``~/.FreeCAD``, create a new directory called "Mod" (if not already present):
```
$ mkdir -p ~/.FreeCAD/Mod
```
* Click on GitHub's "Code" button in the upper right corner and select "Download ZIP".
* Unpack the downloaded archive file and move it to the "Mod" directory:
```
$ sudo apt install unzip
$ unzip /path/to/FreeCAD-APLAN-<branch>.zip -d ~/.FreeCAD/Mod/
```
* After restarting FreeCAD, APLAN should now be available in the workbench selector.

#### Manual installation on Linux distributions w/ using Git
